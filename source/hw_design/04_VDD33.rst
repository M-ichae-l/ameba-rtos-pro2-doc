VDD33 is dedicated to Amebapro 2, because the VDD33 power noise is very large, avoid interfering with others.

Must add another DC-DC BUCK to the peripheral circuit

.. note::

   Some camera sensor modules require 1.2V and 1.8V power rails.
   If these voltages are generated from LDOs powered directly by VDD33, noise from the VDD33 rail may propagate to the sensor supply.

   For noise-sensitive camera modules, it is recommended to use a dedicated 3.3V DC-DC buck converter specifically for the camera power domain.
   This dedicated 3.3V rail should then supply the 1.2V and 1.8V LDO regulators to minimize power noise coupling.

   Refer to :doc:`DC BUCK <03_DC_BUCK>` for DC-DC design guidelines.
   Refer to `DC BUCK <03_DC_BUCK.html>`__ for DC BUCK design.
